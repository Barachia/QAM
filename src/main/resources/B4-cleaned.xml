  <part id="003" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Hello. I know everything about Alice in Wonderland. Is there something you would like to know?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="004" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Well, I've never read the book before, would you recommend it to me?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="005" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Of course I would.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="006" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 OK. What type of book is it? Can you say me something about that?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="007" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 The book is written in the genre of nonsense.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="008" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Nonsense, allright. So, kind of fiction?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="009" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Yes, it is fiction.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="010" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 What type of things happen in the book? Cause I've read the first two pages, and there's no really much of a storyline unraveled yet
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="011" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Alice chases a rabbit.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="012" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Yeah. So, I think at the end of this thing she's just reached the end of the tunnel, I'm guessing this is where Wonderland starts, right?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="013" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Is there something you would like to know about the book?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="014" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Well, I'm wondering what the role of the rabbit is in the rest of the book. Can you say something about that?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="015" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Maybe you should read further chapters.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="016" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Allright, so you don't want to give too much of the story away, I guess. So I was wondering about her cat, Dinah.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="017" type="main">

</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="019" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Dinah was based and named after a cat based on an actual cat owned by Charles <UNK/> or Carroll.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="020" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Is Carroll the author? OK. Are there any things based on the true life in the book?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="021" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Alice was based on Alice <UNK/>, a child friend of Lewis Carroll.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="022" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 OK. So did they have similar adventures together when they were young?
</utterance>
  </part>
