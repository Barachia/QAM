  <part id="053" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Ok, what was his first book?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="054" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 His first book was a Tangled Tale.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="055" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 What was it about?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="056" type="main">

</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="060" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Alice wonders if she was dreaming all the time or not. Is there something you'd like to know about the falling jar of marmelade?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="061" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Yes.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="062" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 It is strange that a bottle of marmelade was falling faster than Alice herself. That is against the laws of physics.

  </part>
  <part id="063" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 True.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="064" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Lewis Carroll knew about this, since he was a mathematician.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="065" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Hmm. Yes, but I think it was in his imagniation. So everything could be contrary of the laws.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="066" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 That is a valid point.
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="067" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="U">	 Okay. So why... did he point that out in his book?
</utterance>
  </part>
  <part id="068" type="main">
    <utterance speaker="A">	 Sorry, I could not get you.
