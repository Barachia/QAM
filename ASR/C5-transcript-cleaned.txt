U: hello can you hear me
A: my name is James
ok have you read Alice in Wonderland
I know everything about Alice in wonder is there anything you would like to know
just tell me what everything you think is interesting about the smoke
would you like to know something about Alice

Alice is 8 years old she was based on Alice Liddell a child friend of York
interesting I did not know that this case of us are playing important role in The Story
doughnut the cat only place or role in chapter 1
so let's just uh I just read I think

very interesting because I know someone that has the same thing as forget I didn't know it was from the book never heard name for well but also a cat in Wonderland if I'm not mistaken
repeat the question
cats in Wonderland if I'm not mistaken
Cheshire cat is in Wonderland
predatory different gas because when Emma's was falling down the Rabbit Hole she was thinking a very much about her gas so there might be a connection between the cat in Wonderland and her cat D not in the real world don't you think
I don't know
it seems so sensible but this guy's in Wonderland can you tell me something about it
Cheshire Cat tries to help Alice find directions to 
to the palace ok it's a very strange that isn't he
the Cheshire cat is very mysterious
definitely what does he look like
Cheshire cat likes to make himself invisible
so it doesn't look like anything then so good if he's not invisible what does this girl look like
he has a scary grim
scary I didn't understand that sorry
Cheshire cat has a scary grin
grim all right I actually only picture of him from the Disney movie Alice in Wonderland Jumanji does enniskerry group ideas for little kids what are interesting characters are there beside the gas
would like to know something about the White Rabbit

the White Rabbit is called w rabbit things Evans is his housemate
I think that
is trapped inside his house
so anyone who stepped inside your house will logically be your housemate just that makes total sense
Alice Wonderland Disney genre
<INTERRUPTION>
I think it's rude to interrupt this conversation

ok thanks
but Alice is trapped inside the house after the rabbit how's that
Roger Brook Ellis Austin shrinks and grows contributors Seagrove
oh she's literally stuck in it as in she can't go through the door or window because she doesn't fit
she does not fit through the door
yeah well dad's in Utah Edit Pro message earlier I was thinking she she's trapped in a household the wild rabbit doesn't let her go out so it's actually mean rabbit but well then then explains it's a nice rabbit but

how to grow and shrink never happens to me 
as often drinks drinks which ratio larger or smaller

sheds drinks she also eats other things are the same
and things are just lying around in Wonderland
Piriton given by characters she means in Wonderland
I would like to meet some people in the real world data could pass myself there was very nice pieces of fruit and drinks well yeah zoella's goes to the palace you mentioned earlier or early she tries to get there does she make it to the palace
she arrives at the palace the Queen
how old Queen you mean the real b**** or is it just the second movie
sorry I did not get that
well in the bird in the new Alice in Wonderland movie I remember the Queen and she's like a total b**** we agree
sorry I don't understand 
in the movie
