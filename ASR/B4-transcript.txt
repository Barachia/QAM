hello
hello madam my name is Jeff
my name is Daniel nice to meet you
hello
I know everything about Alice in Wonderland is there something you would like to know
well I've never read the book before would you recommend it to me
of course I would
so what type of book is it can you show me something about that
the book is written in the genre of nonsense
nonsense
so fanfiction
yes it is fiction
what type of things
happened in the book because I read the first two pages and there's not really
match of the storyline and ruffled yes
Ella's chases a rabbit
so she's I think at the end of this thing she's still falling now she has just reached the end of the tunnel
I'm guessing this is where Wonderland starts
is there something you would like to know about the book
well I'm wondering what's what the role of the rabbit is in the rest of the book
can you say something about that maybe you should read photos
so you don't want to
give too much of the story away I guess
so I was wondering about her cat Dinah
dino is the cat of Alice
does she play a role in The Story as well
Diana was based on named after a cat based on actual cat found by George friends of Harrow
is Carol the author Lewis Carroll
are there any other things based on the true Life in the book
Ellis was based on Alice Liddell
picture of friend of Lewis Carroll
so did they also have similar Adventures together when they were young
sorry I do not know that
is there something you would like to know about cats eating best
yeah why not
you can tell me something about that
sometimes it gets pictures of bats
but does he eat it that's the question
there are no records of cats eating bats
do bats eat cats
turn on dome records
cats eating cats
so is there anything else that we can discuss about
based on the first two pages
is there something you would like to know about the funny jar
alright the orange marmalade
yes the dryer contained orange marmalade
so what was what was left there with the job I wasn't falling too slowly
Lewis Carroll was a mathematician in nudity was different than this
so how far did Alice actually fall
based on the events during the
Ellisfield
quite far
she really reach the centre of the earth as she expected
has reached Wonderland
so where is Wonderland
Wonderland in down the Rabbit Hole
makes sense
so what kind of family was Alice from
will Disney make an animated picture in 1951
yeah thanks
it's rude to interrupt this conversation
ok good to know
so what we were discussing you mentioned something about Disney
Walt Disney made an animated picture in 1951
I think I Saw movie not so long ago about Alice in Wonderland
there is also a non animated picture made by
by who
sorry could you repeat the question
non animated picture that was made by who
I don't know the answer is there a movie of Alice in Wonderland
sorry I do not know that
so does
wonderlands have the same
physics rules as we have here
different rules of gravity
so how do these rules work
sorry I do not know that
are there other things different in Wonderland
ornament is based on on sets
