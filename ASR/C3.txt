Hi Alice.
Hi

Yes, please tell me about Alice.
Alice is 8 years old. She was based on Alice Little. A child friend of the author. Alice owns a cat named Dinah. Dinah is also based on a real cat. Is there something you'd like to know about Lewis Caroll, the author?
Yes, please tell me. I've never heard of him.
Lewis Caroll was a penname for Charles Dodgson. He was born in 1832. He died in 1898. He is a mathematician. Is there something else you'd like to know?
How many books did he write?
Lewis Caroll wrote 12 books in total. His first book was a Tangled Tale.
Did he write... only book for children?
Sorry, I don't know the answer.
The books. He writes books. Only for children or also for adults?
Lewis Caroll wrote books for both adults and children.
Ok, I understand. Thanks.
Is there something you'd like to know about the rabbit?
Yes. Why a white rabbit?
The name of the white rabbit was W. Rabbit.
Ok. And he was the only rabbit in the story?
He is the only rabbit in Alice in Wonderland.
Ok. Thank you.
Is there something else you'd like to know?
No. Thank you.

A: Don't you think it's rude to interrupt our conversation?
Again please.
Don't you think it's rude to interrupt our conversation?
No.. No. Not in this conversat[ion]
[Ok]
So go ahead.
Is there something else you'd like to know?
No, not exactly. I don't have any questions or... Do [you..]
[Is] there something you'd like to know about cats eating bats?
Ah, yes. Do they? Do they eat bats?
Cats sometimes catch bats when the fall on the floor.
But do they eat them?
Sometimes they eat the bats they catch.
Do they like it to eat them?
Sorry, I do not know the answer.
The cats. Do they like to eat a bat? I don't think it's... it's nice. I don't think they like it.
Sorry, I don't know.
What do cats eat normally?
Normally cats eat mice.
Again please, what do they eat?
Normally, cats eat mice.
Ok, yes. Only mice. [Or]
[In] Alice there is a mouse that is afraid of Dinah, the cat.
Ok, I agree, yes. But cats do also eat birds, isn't it.
Cats also eat birds.
Yeah
In Alice in Wonderland there is a bird afraid of Dinah.
Ok.
Is there something else you'd like to know?
Let me see...
Is there somet[hing]
Yeah, yeah. Maybe... Something about the orange marmelade?
The falling jar of marmelade is not supposed to fall faster than Alice during a free fall. This is against the laws of physics.
Ok. So... And the tunnel was very deep?
The tunnel was very deep indeed.
How long took the fall from Alice? How many minutes?
That is unknown. But given the amount of events during the fall, it would've been very long.
She wasn't... She was afraid for the fall?
Alice was not afraid of the fall.
